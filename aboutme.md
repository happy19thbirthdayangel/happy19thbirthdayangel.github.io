I don't even know where to start because everything you do either comes so naturally or you put all the effort you can into whatever you are doing. Inspite of this, I can proudly say that my girlfriend has the following qualities:

- Beautiful (I cant even start or stop talking about how this is true.)
- Crazy (In a cute and sexy way)
- Smart (Don't even say no, I will choke you)
- Kind (One of the first things that caught my attention, was how kind you were to me and your friends)
- Sweet (This kinda ties into the caring aspect of how you percieve people and keep giving them chances and the love you show, and time you share)
- Jealous (I do not do this on purpose but... when you get jealous and over protective >:D I'm a very jolly fellow indeed)
- Funny (This should be #1 tbh, because you have the best sense of humor out of anyone I know, and I mean that so seriously)
- Cute (This should be pretty self-explanatory... idk how you manage to make every-day tasks to be cute but it happens and makes my heart melt every time)
- Voice (My ears and I have been so privileged to have been blessed to hear your voice, and sadly atm one of the rare aspects of our relationship)
- Understanding (I love how you can understand and empathize with whatever emotion that I am trying to convey, as well as understanding the nuances of how life works)
- Telepathic (I dont even know how this is possible, but im gonna assume its quantum physics)

What else do you need?

### Things I would change about you or I guess, things we can work on together <3.
- Eat more (You need input of energy to get anything done)
- Sleep more (Your body needs to heal itself and does that most at night, also good for brain health)
- Workout more (Good cardiovascular health and overall fit-ness and immense benefits.)
- Saying no to people (tbh you have been working on this really hard so I am very proud of you abt this)

At the end of the day, and months and future years that we will spend together, I will always be proud of you no matter what, as long as it's not stupid. MWAH
