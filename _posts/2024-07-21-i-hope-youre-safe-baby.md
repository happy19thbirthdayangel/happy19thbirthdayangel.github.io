Baby I hope you're safe, and everything is going according to plan. Its been over 12 hours since you messaged me and I'm scared that something happened to you ðŸ˜ž

I obviously miss you but the plane ride was supposed to take 10 hours, and it's been over 2 hours since you should have landed I don't know if everything is okay with you. I didn't see anything on the news saying that a plane crashed in Mexico or Near Mexico, or anywhere along the flight path that you might have taken so I'm assuming you're not actually dead.

It's obviously just me overthinking I guess... and.. I might have spammed you on WhatsApp. I really hope your mom doesn't look through anything. 

I hope you're alive babie. Mwahh
