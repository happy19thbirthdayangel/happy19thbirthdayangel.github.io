I don't even know where to begin but I remember around the end of 2023 probably around December, we first started talking and it was on and off.

Your username was chronic pessimist and you had different words posted on your profile and so I guess my very very first impression was that you love complicated words.

Which is funny now that I think about it because You have a hard time struggling to understand certain words LOL, but in any case I liked the idea that you appreciated certain words of literature because I like to speak as non-colloquially as possible.

After that we had our very first conversation about mint chocolate, and this was right after I went to a Christmas party where I was given mint chocolate to take home and I absolutely hated it. I made a post about it on my story and notes I believe and you replied agreeing with me. I guess we bonded over the fact that we mutually hated mint chocolate LMAO

It gets a little foggy around this time because I'm not sure if we just continued to talk, or if you asked if we could talk more but either way we continued to talk. We then started sending and messages over pictures, and I was just taking ceiling photos and you sent me a picture of you and I was absolutely awestruck.

You were and still are literally drop dead gorgeous, beautiful and very attractive. I remember telling you this in voice call, but I love talking about it because I remember very clearly, thinking to myself that I could never even entertain the concept of being in a relationship with you. You were quite literally out of my league.

After this moment in time, we started talking more and I started being flirty and your reciprocated my energy so well and that was extremely insanely attractive as well. I then remember starting to get jealous whenever you mention other guys even if you were casually talking about them or to them in a group chat or dms, and I started calling you, mine.

I regret not asking you out as soon as possible because we were basically in some sort of situationship for a month before I realized and we both made it official LOL

I honestly don't know where you have been my entire life because there's nothing more than I want than for us to grow up together and grow old together. It's pretty difficult having that kind of wish, considering all the events that are happening in today's world. I do believe that everything will work for the best for the both of us, and especially you because you deserve nothing but good and happiness and everything amazing.

I want nothing more than for me to hug you and give you a big kiss and protect you forever ðŸ©·

I love you babie, MWAH
