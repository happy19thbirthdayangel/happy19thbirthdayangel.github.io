I love writing these little letters to you, but anyways...

Why do I love you? From your perspective, you may be wondering why I chose to be with you over other people who are "better", and it may not be something you ever accept which is okay with me. I believe that if you looked at yourself from my perspective, you would have the biggest flood of happy emotions ever, because that is exactly how I feel every time we talk or call or interact in some way. 

It may be a difficult concept for you to accept because you're a silly goose, but everybody has their own love of their own life. To them, or at least most of them, their partner in their relationship is extremely attractive or attractive to say the least. They're obviously allowed to believe that their girlfriend or boyfriend is the most attractive but that's because it's their perspective. 

The only difference with us is, my perspective would be literally every other guy's perspective as well because of how beautiful and cute you are. Your personality and cuteness and adorableness, literally compliment each other so well. I will never ever get bored of you and in fact you get more beautiful each passing day which is insane to me but I'm pretty sure it's a normal thing ig.

In my eyes you are and will always be the most beautiful girl and I love you not because of how beautiful you are on the outside but also how beautiful you are on the inside. Yes, I mean that in two different ways hehe.

My goodness your personality is literally everything that I could ask for, and so so much more. You're funny and have the most amazing sense of humor and kind and caring and loving and so many different qualities that you just show that you have just in the casual course of conversing with other people. You don't even understand how lucky you are to be yourself and how lucky I am to have you.

Your eyes are very pretty, your body is perfect, I love your hair and I love how short you are, and I'm honestly impressed with how strong you are. I genuinely thought from earlier that you would not be able to carry 18 kg but you did LMAO. I love how smart you are and I love how you're consistently pursuing something that you want to pursue without being wavery in spite of difficulties and it's okay to be wavery but giving in is the problem. 

I could honestly go on and on about this but then you would send me the pink yaposaurus picture LOL
