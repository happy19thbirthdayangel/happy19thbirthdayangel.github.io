I know that you'll be safe and take care of yourself because you're my tough little girl, but I can't help but worry about you as you're literally traveling across the world right now ugh :(

I miss you so much and I miss your voice even though I just heard it a couple hours ago. I need you back soon baby, so please make the plane go faster smh.

I hope you sleep well and rest and reset your circadian rhythm to match timezones. I STILL can't believe you're literally so close to me but so far. It is just terribly unfair that I can't meet you right now when that is the only thing that I want and you want UGH.

I feel wierd typing in lowercase because I'm very used to typing in uppercase whenever I talk to you to help convey the tonalities of my communication endeavors.

Wait...

I just realized that I can use emojis 😍 DAMNN and also just I realized that I CAN TYPE IN CAPS WHENEVER I WANT TO BECAUSE I JUST CAN YAYY

DAMN THIS IS WAY BETTER TBH, LESS WIERD AND BORING SOUNDING AND MORE EMOTIONALLY ADAPTED TO CONVEY MY ENERGY, AND TBH IMA JUST SHUT UP CUS IDK WHAT IM SAYING OR EVEN TRYING TO SAY.

ANYWAYS I HOPE THAT YOU LAND SAFE BABY AND MESSAGE ME AND LET ME KNOW YOU'RE ALRIGHT AND THEN IMMEDIATELY REST IF YOU CAN. (im just gonna assume you didn't sleep through your hours long flight)

I LOVE YOU AND I'LL HAVE MY NOTIFS ON WHEN YOU'RE BACK 🩷

MWAHHHH

MWAHHH

MWAHH

MWAH

💘
